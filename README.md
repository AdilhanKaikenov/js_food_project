Healthy food delivery project.  

In this project I have implemented:
1) AJAX and communication with the server
2) Implementation of the script for sending data to the server
3) Alert the user with a popup modal window
4) Receiving data from the server. Async / Await (ES8)
5) Created a slider on the site
6) Created a calculator on the site
7) Created a countdown timer on the site
8) Used the technique of splitting into modules (ES6 Modules)  
... and more

The following can be used as a local server:

**JSON-server**  

```
npm install -g json-server
```
After:
```
npx json-server db.json
```
or
```
npx run json-server db.json
```
(!) May differ on some systems.

**Webpack.**  

To build a project:
```
